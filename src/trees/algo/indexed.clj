  "Algos that pick values from a vector using tree indices.

   - Tree depths and sibling indices are **1-based**, i.e. 1 is the trunk.
   - Vector lookup is still 0-based as in Clojure, so index N in the tree maps
     to element (N - 1) in the vector.
   - Indices beyond the vectorâ€™s length are clamped to the last element.
   - Empty vectors are invalid and will throw."
