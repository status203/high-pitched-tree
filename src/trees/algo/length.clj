(defn scale
  "Returns a branch-length function.
  
  Given a zipper positioned on a branch node where a child will be added,
  computes the child's length as:
  
      base-length * (scale ^ (depth - 1))
  
  Thus, each successive branch is a fixed multiple (scale) of its parentâ€™s
  length. A scale < 1 produces shrinking branches, while a scale > 1
  produces growing branches."
