(defn ratio
  "Returns a branch-length function.
  
  Given a zipper positioned on a branch node where a child will be added,
  computes the child's length as:
  
      base-length * (ratio ^ (depth - 1))
  
  Thus, each successive branch is a fixed multiple (ratio) of its parentâ€™s
  length. A ratio < 1 produces shrinking branches, while a ratio > 1
  produces growing branches."
